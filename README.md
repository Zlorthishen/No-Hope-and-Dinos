# No Hope and Dinos

## Description:

CDDA Mod. It's like No Hope, but replaces zombies with dinosaurs, and requires TropiCataclysm and Dinomod. Removes portals and portal storms. Only spawn Dinosaurs, Robots, Cyborgs, Mutants, Insects, Worms and Wildlife. Removes Triffids, Fungus, Exodii, Nether-stuff and everything not whitelisted.

I designed this with these paramters in mind: loot spawn at [0.05 to 0.2] and monster spawn rate at [4.00 to 5.00]. City size [2], city spacing [6].

Modify the exclusions.json and modinfo.json and game_balance.json as desired to tweak the mod.

## Known issues: 

Dinomod zoo stuff is not spawing. including the missed scenario spawnpoint for the dino gift shop.

Tons of corpses. It's a mad world.
